## Chickwt Data-set


 
```{r}
chickwts <- as_tibble(chickwts)
```
#summary 
```{r }
summary(chickwts)
```
#mean
```{r}
mean(chickwts$weight)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r feed, echo=FALSE}
plot (chickwts$feed)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
